# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

<p> This project is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors using javascript functions as an assignment for The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. It features a fully fledged (amazing) rock, paper, scissors game. For the browser version, which uses DOM methods and event listeners, check the **dom_version** folder. For the console version, check the **console_version** folder. </p>
